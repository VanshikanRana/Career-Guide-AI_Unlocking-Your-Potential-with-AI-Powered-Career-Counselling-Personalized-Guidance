# Career Guide AI: Unlocking Your Potential with AI-Powered Career Counselling and Personalized Guidance

**Career Guide AI** is an intelligent chatbot designed to assist freshers with their college-related inquiries. Developed during my summer industrial training at Codroid Hub, this AI-driven project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to provide personalized career counseling and guidance.

## Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Uses advanced NLP techniques to understand and respond to student queries.
- **Personalized Guidance**: Offers tailored advice based on the user's needs and questions.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Engages with users in a conversational manner, making the experience intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Built with TensorFlow and TFLearn**: The project utilizes powerful libraries like TensorFlow, TFLearn, and NLTK for building and training the model.

## How It Works:
1. The chatbot tokenizes and processes user input using NLTK.
2. The input is then stemmed and compared against a set of predefined patterns to classify the query.
3. The model predicts the most appropriate response from the trained dataset, guiding the user with relevant information.

## Usage:
Run the chatbot and start asking questions! Whether you need help with course selection, career advice, or general college information, Career Guide AI is here to help.
